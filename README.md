# About #

This program takes an inputted complex number s = a + bi
and computes c ^ s for an inputted c. It then computes the first
n terms of the sum 1 - 2^-s + 3^-s - 4^-s . . .

## Purpose ##

This program was made to help visualize the affect of changing a,
b when a number is raised to the a + bi, as well as to help
visualize the analytic continuation for the Riemann zeta function
defined when 0 < Re(s) < 1
